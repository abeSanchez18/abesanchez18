I am Abraham, a student at Roosevelt University, majoring in Computer Science. Since 2020, I've been working in IT specifically in the desktop, helpdesk, and assest management space. I decided to return to school as a full time student to expand my knowledge and skill set in software engineering. Coding has always been a hobby for me due to its task to manipulate. I'm currently learning Java, Python, and SQL.
